        "description": "<p>(UPDATE) MORE than a million members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) converged at the Quirino Grandstand on Monday for a National Peace Rally, calling for national unity and calm as political tensions escalate.</p>\n\n<p>According to a report by the Philippine National Police (PNP), the crowd swelled to 1.5 million by noon.</p>\n\n<p>The PNP said the situation remained peaceful as the tally of attendees continued to increase.</p>\n\n<p>Simultaneous rallies were also held in cities across the country, including Legazpi, Ilagan, and Puerto Princesa in Luzon; Cebu, Iloilo, and Bacolod in the Visayas; and Davao, Pagadian, Butuan, and Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao.</p>\n\n<p>The massive turnout reflected the INC's ability to draw vast numbers in support of its call for peace. The crowd, composed of families, students, and elderly participants, carried banners and placards with messages like \"Kapayapaan para sa Bayan\" (Peace for the Nation) and \"Pagkakaisa sa Gitna ng Pagsubok\" (Unity Amid Challenges).</p>\n\n<p>The peaceful atmosphere at the Quirino Grandstand mirrored the rally's overarching theme. The absence of disturbances, as noted in the PNP's report, stood in stark contrast to the political turbulence gripping the country.</p>\n\n<p>However, while INC leaders maintained that the rally was apolitical and solely focused on fostering peace, many attendees expressed sentiments that blurred the lines between advocating for unity and supporting embattled Vice President Sara Duterte. Analysts saw the rally as an effort to shield the vice president from impeachment in connection with her alleged misuse of confidential funds, charges she has denied.</p>\n\n<p>The INC opposes moves to impeach Duterte in the House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>\"There are many more things which our citizens need that must be attended to. These will not be achieved if all we see taking place is conflict,\" church spokesman Edwil Zabala said ahead of the rally.</p>\n\n<p>Duterte said the INC rally on Monday was a powerful show of unity.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking in Filipino, Duterte thanked INC members for their \"continued effort to bring understanding and unity to our countrymen.\"</p>\n\n<p>She said that amid poverty and other challenges, \"a peaceful and united Philippines will never waver and will always rise amid the challenge of the times.\"</p>\n\n<p>Several participants interviewed by The Manila Times on Monday revealed their concerns about the impeachment complaints against Duterte. Many openly opposed the efforts to unseat her, citing the need to preserve government stability amid deepening divisions.</p>\n\n<p>Early in the morning, 75-year-old Edgardo arrived with his wife and neighbors from Laguna. Holding a handwritten sign that read \"Itigil ang Impeachment, Bigyan ng Kapayapaan ang Bayan\" (Stop the Impeachment, Give Peace to the Nation), Ramos called on politicians to \"not make the situation worse.</p>\n\n<p>\"The government needs to unite for the nation,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kat and Christine, cousins from San Fernando in Pampanga, said they joined the rally to express their hopes for a unified and stable nation.</p>\n\n<p>\"Ang gulo-gulo na ng nangyayari. Parang wala nang nagkakasundo sa mga lider natin (Things are so chaotic now. It seems like none of our leaders can agree on anything),\" Kat said, lamenting the chaotic political climate.</p>\n\n<p>Christine echoed her cousin's sentiments, saying that they joined the event to show they want unity.</p>\n\n<p>\"Kaya kami nandito ay para ipakita na gusto namin ng pagkakaisa. Suportado namin ang panawagan para sa kapayapaan (We're here to show that we want unity. We support the call for peace),\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Young attendees, such as 18-year-old students Carlo and Adrian from Taguig City, voiced their fears about the nation's future.</p>\n\n<p>\"Kapag nagpatuloy ang hindi pagkakaunawaan, baka lalo pang magkagulo (If misunderstandings continue, the situation might worsen),\" Carlo said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sana po magkaisa ang mga lider natin para hindi maapektuhan ang mga Pilipino (I hope our leaders unite so Filipinos won't be affected),\" Adrian added.</p>\n\n<p>Others traveled great distances to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Nora, 63, from Antipolo City, arrived early with her friends, holding a sign that read \"Kapayapaan para sa Bayan\" (Peace for the Nation).</p>\n\n<p>\"Nandito kami para ipakita na mahalaga ang pagkakaisa. Ayaw naming magulo ang Pilipinas (We're here to show that unity is important. We don't want the Philippines to be in chaos),\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Alfredo, a 72-year-old retired teacher from Laoag, Ilocos Norte, journeyed overnight with his family to join the rally.</p>\n\n<p>\"Hindi namin gusto ang impeachment. Kailangan magkaisa ang lahat para hindi lumala ang problema (We don't want impeachment. Everyone needs to unite to prevent the problem from worsening),,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>The rally unfolded against the backdrop of three impeachment complaints filed in the House of Representatives against Vice President Duterte.</p>\n\n<p>During the rally, Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna said the local government of Manila is supporting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s opposition to the impeachment of Vice President Duterte.</p>\n\n<p>\"The local government of Manila supports our President's call regarding the impeachment,\" Lacuna said in an interview at the Quirino Grandstand.</p>\n\n<p>Lacuna said she attended the rally to join the church's call for unity within the government.</p>\n\n<p>\"The City of Manila is here to join calls for unity and peace,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Malaca\u00f1ang expressed hope that the \"National Rally for Peace\" initiated by the INC would help clarify many issues being faced by the nation.</p>\n\n<p>Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin made the remark as he reiterated that moving to peaceably assemble is a \"bedrock right\" of the people, recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution and respected by the present leadership.</p>\n\n<p>The state disaster agency said extensive emergency response measures have been implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of all attendees.</p>\n\n<p>Edwin Nasol, vice president for disaster preparedness and emergency response of the Society Communicators and Networks (SCAN), said 17,000 emergency first responders from the INC were deployed to attend to all kinds of medical issues confronting the participants.</p>\n\n<p>He said the comprehensive response team was supported by 120 personnel from the Manila Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, who worked alongside two light urban search and rescue teams from the Philippine Army's 525th Engineer Combat Battalion.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, 5,000 personnel from the Philippine National Police and 1,200 members of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) were also on hand to maintain order and assist with crowd management.</p>\n\n<p>The MMDA said they observed heavier traffic than usual from Monday morning until the afternoon, particularly along the Quiapo area in Manila, while the INC held a peace rally at the Quirino Grandstand.</p>\n\n<p>MMDA Chairman Don Artes said several streets saw increased traffic, particularly in Manila and Pasay.</p>\n\n<p>The PNP said that as of 10 a.m., some 1.5 million people attended the gathering at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila for the INC rally.</p>\n\n<p>Several roads were closed, too, to give way to the rally.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Commission on Elections Chairman George Erwin Garcia expressed support for the INC's nationwide \"peace rally,\" even as he said he despised any attempt by political aspirants to use the gathering for their personal interest in relation to the upcoming midterm polls.</p>\n\n<p>Garcia said the INC has all the good intentions in organizing the rally and should not be taken advantage of by grandstanding politicians to jumpstart their campaign for the coming May 12, 2025 national and local elections.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Imee Marcos, a staunch ally of the vice president, said the INC rally for peace was \"not against\" the separation between the Church and the State.</p>\n\n<p>She made the remark as fellow senators Francis Tolentino and Ronald Dela Rosa attended the event held at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila.</p>\n\n<p>\"The peace rally is sanctioned, and in fact, encouraged, by the free speech clause of our Constitution,\" Marcos said.</p>\n\n<p>Senate President Francis Escudero said, \"A prayer rally for peace and unity in the country, I believe, is non-debatable. Who wouldn't want that? I surely want that.\"</p>\n\n<p>WITH BERNADETTE E. TAMAYO, FRANCIS EARL CUETO, WILLIAM B. DEPASUPIL, FRANCISCO TUYAY AND AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</p>",

        "description": "<p>THE government is poised to investigate an alleged \"grand conspiracy\" in the Philippine National Police (PNP) to sweep controversial drug cases under the rug.</p>\n\n<p>Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla made the remark following the filing of administrative charges against 30 policemen, including several high-ranking officers, involved in a 2022 \"simulated\" buy-bust in Manila that resulted in the largest drug haul in the country.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our theory is this all goes all the way to 2016 until they are caught in 2022. It seems that it became a standard procedure of some elements of the PNP to seize a haul, give a partial report, and then stash away the rest,\" Remulla said in a briefing in Malaca\u00f1ang.</p>\n\n<p> \"There seems to be a grand conspiracy to conceal a criminal enterprise. Look at the case, from sergeant to chief PNP; all are included in the story,\" he added.</p>\n\n<p>The official was referring to a \"drug raid\" on a company called Wealth and Personal Development Lending Inc. (WPD Lending) on Oct. 8, 2022, which led to the seizure of 990 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride, also known as \"shabu\" worth P6.7 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Arrested during the operation were Master Sgt. Rodolfo Mayo, a member of the PNP Drug Enforcement Group and one of the respondents and a certain Ney Atadero.</p>\n\n<p>Also implicated were Lt. Gen Benjamin Santos, BGen. Narciso Domingo, Col. Julian Olonan, Col. Arnulfo Iba\u00f1ez, Lt. Col. Dhefry Punzalan, Lt. Col. Glenn Gonzalez, Maj. Michael Angelo Salmingo, Chief MSgt. Emmanuele Docena, SMSgt. Jerrywin Rebosora, SMSgt.

He was dismissed from service on March 21, 2023, over three counts of grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a police officer.</p>\n\n<p>Remulla asserted that the alleged cover-up may have stemmed from the \"reward system\" instituted by the PNP in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>\"So, what happened was, they would make an arrest, give a reward, and then grant a promotion. That became their system,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Remulla said the investigation would be conducted by his department, the Department of Justice and their attached agencies.</p>\n\n<p>He said no one would be spared should their investigation show that more police personnel had conspired to cover up their or their colleagues' involvement in bogus anti-narcotics operations from the past administration to the present leadership.</p>",

        "description": "<p>THE National Maritime Council (NMC) on Monday condemned the continued illegal presence of Chinese ships within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ).</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, the NMC said the two vessels of the China Coast Guard (CCG) \u2014 identified as CCG 5901 and CCG 3304 \u2014 have been operating unlawfully in the waters around Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) 70 to 90 nautical miles off the coastline of Zambales on Jan. 5 and 10, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>It also called out Beijing's deployment of a People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) helicopter, \"which hovered above a PCG (Philippine Coast Guard) vessel that was lawfully conducting its mandate in a peaceful, non-provocative, and professional manner.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"These actions are clear violations of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act (Republic Act 12064) and international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) and the 2016 Arbitral Ruling that affirmed the Philippines' sovereign rights in its maritime zones, especially in the West Philippine Sea (WPS),\" the NMC said.</p>\n\n<p>These \"escalatory actions,\" it further stated, are inconsistent with the exercise of freedom of navigation and innocent passage as well as the exercise of rights and observance of duties by other States in the Philippines' EEZ under the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and the 1982 Unclos and the 2016 Arbitral Ruling.</p>\n\n<p>These incidents prompted the Philippine government to file another diplomatic protest against China, asserting that the Philippines has long-standing sovereignty over Bajo de Masinloc and its territorial sea as well as \"over waters within the Philippines' EEZ measured from its lawful archipelagic baselines.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"These maritime zones, as declared in the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, are in accordance with the 1982 Unclos and the 2016 Arbitral Ruling. China does not have any basis to conduct law enforcement activities or maritime patrols over these waters,\" the NMC said.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Philippines remains resolute in asserting and protecting its sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the WPS, and urges China to observe Philippine laws and comply with its obligations under international law, particularly Unclos. China should direct its vessels to desist from conducting illegal actions that violate the Philippines' sovereign rights in its EEZ,\" it added.</p>\n\n<p>This was not the first time the government denounced the encroachment of Chinese vessels in Bajo de Masinloc.</p>\n\n<p>A few days after ringing in the new year, the National Security Council (NSC) tagged as an act of \"intimidation, coercion, and aggression\" the CCG's \"Monster Ship\" patrol operations in the Philippines' EEZ.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Risa Hontiveros, meanwhile, reiterated her appeal to Malaca\u00f1ang to file new cases against China before an international court amid reports that China's \"Monster\" navy ship is back in Zambales.</p>\n\n<p>The senator said China is not starting the year right. \"Instead of keeping the peace in the region, she has chosen to create more disturbance,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Beijing's ships will only keep coming back if we do not take appropriate measures,\" Hontiveros said in a statement on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>\"In the meantime, we must work on strengthening alliances with like-minded nations whose coast guards can patrol with ours,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Hontiveros added, \"Together, let us show China that no 'Monster' ship can scare us.\"</p>\n\n<p>Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada said the repeated incursions of China Coast Guard vessels into Philippine waters, particularly within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), \"require a comprehensive and proactive response from our government.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I think it's crucial to take action now. We need a proactive, united, and sustained approach to protect our rights and ensure the safety and security of our people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Philippines will not yield to coercion or intimidation when faced with challenges to our sovereignty,\" Estrada said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>He said the 2016 Arbitral Award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, Netherlands, \"affirmed our claim to sovereign rights in the maritime areas of the West Philippine Sea.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>(UPDATE) THE Supreme Court has reaffirmed the democratic rights of citizens to run for public office, irrespective of their financial means.</p>\n\n<p>In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court said a candidate's lack of financial resources to fund a nationwide campaign does not automatically make him or her a nuisance candidate.</p>\n\n<p>The en banc ruling, written by Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, overturned previous resolutions by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) that invalidated the candidacy of Juan Olila Ollesca in the 2022 presidential elections.</p>\n\n<p>The case began in October 2021, when Ollesca, a business owner, filed his certificate of candidacy (COC) to run as an independent candidate for the presidency. Shortly thereafter, the Comelec Law Department petitioned to declare Ollesca a nuisance candidate, arguing that he was neither well-known nor possessed the resources to mount a nationwide campaign capable of achieving national recognition.</p>\n\n<p>The Comelec's Second Division granted the petition, declaring Ollesca a nuisance candidate. The Comelec en banc upheld this decision, denying Ollesca's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n\n<p>The high court emphasized that in a democracy, every citizen has the right to seek public office, a principle that must be balanced with the practical need to maintain free, fair, and orderly elections. The law, it stated, allows Comelec to regulate candidacies to avoid confusion, excessive resource allocation, and voter deception.</p>\n\n<p>The Court stressed that the criteria for declaring a nuisance candidate must adhere to legal standards. It is the responsibility of the Comelec to present substantial evidence that a candidate lacks genuine intent to run for office. Factors such as the absence of a political party nomination, limited public recognition, or insufficient campaign funds cannot, on their own, serve as definitive proof of a lack of intent.</p>\n\n<p>The Court further noted that disqualifying candidates based on their financial capacity would effectively impose a property requirement for public office \u2014 a practice explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>It stressed that the central consideration should be whether a candidate enjoys significant public support, not their likelihood of success or campaign resources.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's decision said the ability to fund a campaign does not equate to sincerity or competence in running for public office. Wealth, it argued, should not be a prerequisite for leadership.</p>",

(Meralco) said on Monday it will be charging its customers P0.2189 less per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in January.</p>\n\n<p>The January billing for a typical household will be P11.7428, down from December's P11.9617, Meralco said.</p>\n\n<p>Residential customers consuming 200 kWh will be charged around P44 less.</p>\n\n<p>Meralco attributed the lower rate to the P0.1313 per kWh drop in the generation charge after the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) charge went down by P0.8840 and the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) charge by P0.1593.</p>\n\n<p>Meralco said WESM reduced its charges after average peak demand and average capacity in the Luzon Grid both went down.</p>\n\n<p>IPP charges were also down because of the appreciation of the peso, affecting 97 percent of IPP costs that were dollar-denominated, together with the lower cost of fuel and higher dispatch of the First Gas-Sta. Rita plant.</p>\n\n<p>The reductions in turn tempered the P0.5638 per kWh increase in charges from Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) due to lower plant dispatch.</p>\n\n<p>WESM, IPPs, and PSAs accounted for 34 percent, 30 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, of Meralco's total energy requirement for the period.</p>\n\n<p>As for the other parts of the bill transmission and other charges also registered a net reduction of P0.0876 per kWh, while pass-through charges for generation and transmission are paid to the power suppliers and the grid operator, respectively, while taxes, universal charges, and Feed-in Tariff Allowance (FIT-All) are all remitted to the government.</p>\n\n<p>Meralco's distribution charge, on the other hand, has not moved since the P0.0360 per kWh reduction for a typical residential customer in August 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Meralco reminded customers to practice energy efficiency despite lower rates for January to better manage their electricity consumption as the dry season approaches.</p>",

Janette Garin withheld from them Dengvaxia's four fatal serious adverse effects \u2014 neurotropism, viscerotropism, severe dengue and anaphylaxis.</p>\n\n<p>To address the risk and ensure appropriate post-marketing surveillance in the Philippines, Sanofi said \"Pharmacovigilance Plan deployed in the Philippines will consist of passive or routine surveillance and active surveillance\" that involves post-authorization safety studies, post-authorization effectiveness studies and clinical studies.</p>\n\n<p>Sanofi, in an official statement issued in November 2017, said: \"the analysis confirmed that Dengvaxia provides persistent protective benefit against dengue fever in those who had prior infection. For those not previously infected by dengue virus, however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection.\"</p>\n\n<p>The parents of the eight school children whose deaths were linked to the controversial anti-dengue shot had filed administrative complaints before the Supreme Court's Office of the Court Administrator for \"being biased and partial\" against Marcos-Padaen, who eventually inhibited herself from handling the case.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewed by this newspaper on Monday, Cairo confirmed what he said in his affidavits when he testified as one of the prosecution witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>\"When I handled the dengue program of the DOH and helped in the orientation and training of personnel from various local government units about Dengvaxia, they (Garin and other DOH officials) never disclosed to us these four potential risks,\" Cairo said.</p>\n\n<p>\"As a result, all of us including the trainers and vaccinators were unaware about these fatal risks from Dengvaxia,\" he added.</p>\n\n<p>Had the potential risks of the vaccine been disclosed to them prior to the personnel orientation and training for the planned mass vaccination that began in 2016 with the P3.5-billion Dengvaxia purchase, Cairo said \"more lives would have been spared and saved.\"</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, independent health reform advocate and prosecution witness Dr. Tony Leachon, a former DOH official and Covid-19 task force consultant, said that he would not stop from exposing the truth amid smear campaigns against him.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is the fight I have taken up not because it is easy but because it is necessary,\" Leachon told this writer.</p>\n\n<p>\"The question we need to ask right now is: Why are they so intent on silencing those who speak the truth, why are they so afraid of accountability,\" he added.</p>\n\n<p>Leachon maintained that he would not be moved and affected.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can attack me, deploy your trolls and flood social media with lies but you cannot drown out the truth. I will not stop fighting for the millions of Filipinos who deserve better,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>More than 1 million Filipinos, mostly children, were reportedly the recipients of Dengvaxia vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>Garin and co-respondents \u2014 seven of them doctors \u2014 and executives from Sanofi and vaccine distributor Zuellig Pharma, are facing reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, among others.</p>",

Gone are the conspicuous protrusions of Google Glass and the bulky frames and cables of Epson's Moverio from the early 2010s.</p>\n\n<p>Today's smart glasses, all paired with smartphone apps, increasingly resemble traditional eyewear. The Ray-Ban Meta, developed by Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant, currently leads the market with this new approach.</p>\n\n<p>According to a recent MarketsandMarkets study, the sector's growth is \"driven by advancements in augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and miniaturization technologies, which are pushing the boundaries of what these wearable devices can achieve.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, integrating technology into fashionable frames requires careful compromise.</p>\n\n<p>The Ray-Ban Meta, for instance, can capture photos and videos, play music, and provide information about objects in view, but it doesn't offer augmented reality with superimposed images.</p>\n\n<p>Meta representative Robin Dyer explained that while AR capabilities may come later, they would likely double the current price.</p>\n\n<p>200 dollars</p>\n\n<p>Price is a major battleground in this market, particularly with the entry of Chinese manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>While Google Glass initially retailed for around $1,500 in 2013, today's smart glasses are approaching the price of premium conventional frames.</p>\n\n<p>Meta's James Nickerson noted that their Ray-Ban collaboration starts at $300, just $50 more than standard Ray-Bans, offering \"a cool camera\" as a bonus.</p>\n\n<p>California startup Vue has pushed prices even lower, offering basic models with voice assistant and music capabilities for $200.</p>\n\n<p>Some manufacturers, like XReal, focus on augmented reality, projecting smartphone, computer, or gaming console displays \u2014 though this is a market for which Apple's Vision Pro failed to create excitement last year.</p>\n\n<p>For AR, recent advances help move away from the bulk of a virtual reality headset toward that of classic sunglasses, even if they require a cable to be connected to the device.</p>\n\n<p>Meta's ambition is to launch its own pared-down version, the Orion, currently in the test phase but not expected to be marketed until 2027 at the earliest.</p>\n\n<p>Chasing cool</p>\n\n<p>Companies like Even Realities and Halliday are pioneering ultra-thin frames that look identical to standard glasses while offering basic AR capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>\"If we want to make a good pair of smart glasses, we must first make a pair of cool glasses,\" emphasized Carter Hou, Halliday's second-in-command.</p>",

        "description": "<p>SEN. Bong Go said the funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) should serve the public's health needs rather than be unutilized, mishandled or diverted.</p>\n\n<p>The chairman of the Senate Committee on Health reiterated his appeal to PhilHealth to \"accelerate overdue reforms, maximize available funds and meet healthcare needs of the poor.\"</p>\n\n<p>Go emphasized the importance of ensuring that \"every peso contributed by citizens to PhilHealth is used effectively.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a radio interview on Jan. 9, Go addressed concerns about PhilHealth's alleged mismanagement and inefficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>He said health care funds \"should be used solely for improving health services.\"</p>\n\n<p>Go cited past instances of questionable plans, including the transfer of PhilHealth's excess funds to the National Treasury, which he slammed as \"counterproductive and morally wrong.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Don't wait for you (PhilHealth) to generate excess funds. Use that for our poor fellowmen,\" he said in Filipino.</p>\n\n<p>The senator highlighted real-life cases where PhilHealth's policies \"fell short in serving Filipinos.\"</p>\n\n<p>Go recounted the plight of a provincial health officer from Camarines Norte who \"faced staggering hospital bills amounting to millions but received minimal coverage from PhilHealth.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also pressured the agency to scrap the 24-hour confinement policy, which required patients to be admitted for at least a day before they could qualify for insurance coverage. PhilHealth officials have since committed to its removal.</p>\n\n<p>Go expressed disappointment over the zero government subsidy allocated to PhilHealth for 2025, questioning how the agency could expand its services without adequate funding.</p>",

        "description": "<p>THE Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) has ramped up its efforts against the illegal online sale of registered Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards, conducting 55 operations in 2024 that resulted in the arrest of 65 people, six of them convicted, so far.</p>\n\n<p>Those arrested face charges under multiple laws, including Republic Act (RA) 12010, known as the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (Afasa); Section 7 of RA 11934, or the SIM Registration Act; and Section 6 of RA 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.</p>\n\n<p>During these operations, law enforcers seized more than 6,200 SIM cards, which included over 3,000 registered SIMs, and 29 connected to e-wallet accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Gen. Bernard Yang, officer-in-charge of the PNP-ACG, urged the public to assist in combating this illegal activity by reporting any information related to the unauthorized sale of registered SIM cards.</p>\n\n<p>\"Timely reporting enables swift and decisive action against these activities,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent operation was carried out last Jan. 8 at 3:05 p.m. in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija. The Regional Anti-Cybercrime Unit 3 (RACU-3) of the PNP-ACG conducted an entrapment operation that led to the arrest of three individuals involved in the illegal online sale of registered SIM cards.</p>\n\n<p>The investigation began with cyber patrol efforts by RACU-3 personnel, who identified a Facebook user advertising registered SIM cards for sale. The seller offered the SIM cards at P19 each for bulk purchases. This intelligence culminated in a successful sting operation resulting in the confiscation of 7,000 registered SIM cards.</p>\n\n<p>Yang commended the efforts of RACU-3 personnel, emphasizing the importance of their work in protecting the public from cyber-related crimes.</p>\n\n<p>\"The sale of registered SIM cards facilitates illegal activities, such as identity theft, fraud, and other cybercrimes,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Yang urged the public to remain vigilant and report any instances of illegal SIM card sales to the PNP-ACG.</p>\n\n<p>\"Your cooperation is vital in ensuring a safer digital environment for everyone,\" he said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Manila 2nd District Representative Rolando Valeriano has called on government employees, especially those in uniformed services, to uphold high moral standards and respect family values.</p>\n\n<p>His statement comes in the wake of the case of resigned Senior Fire Officer 2 Reyca Janisa Palpallatoc, whose license as a registered nurse is under review following allegations of immorality.</p>\n\n<p>\"Love affairs may occur between individuals, but when such relationships result in the destruction of a family and cause emotional distress to a spouse and their loved ones, the aggrieved party has the right to seek proper recourse,\" Valeriano said over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>The controversy surrounding Palpallatoc grew after a Pasay City court issued a warrant for her arrest on charges of illegal recruitment within the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). </p>\n\n<p>The immorality complaint against Palpallatoc was filed with the Professional Regulation Commission Board of Nursing in December by Faizah Utuali.</p>\n\n<p>Utuali claimed that Palpallatoc was having an affair with her husband, a discharged Marine officer.</p>\n\n<p>In her affidavit, Utuali highlighted the broader implications of Palpallatoc's actions emphasizing that such misconduct \"tarnishes the dignity of the nursing profession and erodes public confidence in government institutions.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"As professionals, we are obligated to respect others' rights, including the right to a peaceful family life. Engaging in extramarital affairs not only violates moral standards but also contravenes laws designed to protect families and the rights of legal spouses,\" said Valeriano who serves as the chairman of the House Committee on Metro Manila Development.</p>\n\n<p>The lawmaker said that uniformed personnel, such as those in the BFP, police, and military, must act as moral exemplars as their personal conduct reflects on the institutions they represent and inappropriate behavior undermines public trust.</p>",
